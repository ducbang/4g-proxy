Thank to CGNAT, 4G mobile proxies are superior to every other type of proxy as it camouflages the bots and/or automation software. This happens because the public IPV4 address used by the 4G mobile proxy is simultaneously used by hundreds or real users which makes IP bans a lot more difficult since 99% of the time the traffic fingerprint coming from the IP address will look 100% normal no matter how aggressive your automation settings are.
